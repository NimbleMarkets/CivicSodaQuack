// Package confidence measures how much of the evidence behind an answer
// actually survives to support it.
//
// # The formula
//
// For each dataset a query reads, three counts:
//
//	E  rows the portal holds        (the reference count)
//	H  rows held locally
//	U  rows held in which every column the query reads carries usable
//	   information — not null, and for a timestamp, a date that could be real
//
// The dataset's retention is the share of the intended evidence that survives,
// and the query's reliability is the product across its datasets:
//
//	completeness = min(1, H/E)     did the rows arrive
//	usability    = U/H             do they carry what the query reads
//
//	r = completeness × usability             R = ∏ r
//
// which is U/E whenever the local copy is no larger than the reference count.
// It parts company with U/E only when a dataset has grown since it was mapped:
// completeness saturates at 1 rather than exceeding it, so surplus rows cannot
// pay for a defect elsewhere in the product, and the usable share is then
// measured against what is actually held rather than against a stale
// denominator.
//
// # Why this is the whole model
//
// Every term is a count divided by a count. There are no weights, no severity
// coefficients, no saturation points and no thresholds anywhere in the
// arithmetic — nothing to tune, and therefore nothing to tune wrongly. Two
// scores are comparable because they are the same measurement, not because two
// tables of constants happened to agree.
//
// R is not an index. It is a quantity with a plain reading: the share of the
// records the query meant to consult that were actually there and usable. When
// R is 54%, a count taken from that answer rests on 54% of the records the
// portal holds. That sentence is the whole interpretation.
//
// For one dataset that reading is exact — R is U/E. For a query reading
// several, R is their product, which reads "every dataset held up" rather than
// "this share of the pooled records held up". The two differ: two datasets each
// retaining half give R = 25%, while half of the pooled records survived. The
// conjunctive reading is exact for a join, where a row needs every side to be
// usable, and is a lower bound for a union. It is the conservative of the two,
// which is the right direction for a number whose purpose is to stop someone
// over-claiming. Callers presenting R for a multi-dataset query should say
// "every dataset behind this answer", not "this share of the records".
//
// An earlier version of this package scored eight checks using hand-chosen
// severity floors and saturation points — about twenty constants, each
// defensible alone and none of them derived. Six of the eight turned out to be
// the same measurement wearing different clothes: rows that do not survive.
// Stating it once removed every constant with it.
//
// # What is deliberately not scored
//
// Freshness and lag are reported beside R, never folded into it. Staleness
// removes no rows, so it has no reading as evidence loss; and how much
// 122-day-old data matters depends entirely on the question — fine for a 2023
// trend, useless for "what happened last week" — which csq cannot know. Any
// coefficient placed there would be invented, so the age is stated as a fact
// and left to the reader, who knows what they are asking.
//
// Concentration is likewise reported and never scored: one vendor holding most
// of a total is a fact about procurement, not a defect in the data.
//
// # What R does not mean
//
// It measures the evidence, not the truth. A dataset that is complete, current
// and fully populated scores 100% while recording something other than what a
// reader believes it records, or recording it with a bias no count can see. R
// is a ceiling on how much can be known from this corpus, never a statement
// that the finding is correct.
