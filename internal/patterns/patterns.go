// Package patterns builds modes from analysis shapes rather than from a
// question. Everything it needs is the schema of tables already held, so
// building a mode makes no network call of any kind.
//
// The observation behind it is that most civic analysis is a handful of shapes.
// "Which vendors got the most money", "which contractors pull the most permits",
// "who receives the most contributions" are one shape — rank entities by a
// summed measure — pointed at different columns. A dozen such shapes cover most
// of what people actually ask, and each can be written once, by hand, and
// reviewed.
//
// That has an advantage over drafting beyond cost. The caveats that matter most
// are properties of the *shape*, not of the data: a top-N ranking always hides
// its tail, a free-text entity column always understates concentration because
// the same body appears under several spellings, a count by month is always
// distorted by a partial final month. Written once against the pattern, those
// are reviewed prose rather than something regenerated — and correct every time
// the pattern is used.
//
// A pattern produces exactly the documents `csq modes personal` produces, and
// they go through the same loader, the same read-only guard, and the same
// EXPLAIN check. Nothing downstream can tell the two apart, which is the point:
// the model was always just one way to write the file.

// the same mode rather than two similar ones.
